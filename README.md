# Panda-Business

homework 9 due: 150 word business idea created by your group and all commit to same repo

Our business is a Seattle based Airbnb rental management company. Users of the site would be people who list short term rentals on the Airbnb app and website in the Seattle area. 

The user would create an account on our website and an Airbnb API would feed their check in / check out times to our site, which would trigger our company to know when to turn the homes with a cleaning service at check out. Our company can also arrange for a person to meet renters at check in with the keys and to show them around the home and provide any additional information. Extra add on services our company would provide would include welcome baskets for guests and coupons to special events.

A simple and cleanly designed website and app, catchy name, and convenience will resignate with users to streamline their experience.
