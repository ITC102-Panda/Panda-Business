# Panda-Business

homework 9 due: 150 word business idea created by your group and all commit to same repo

Our business is a Seattle based Airbnb rental management company. Users of the site would be people who list short term rentals on the Airbnb app and website in the Seattle area. They would create an account on our website and would have an Airbnb API that feeds their check in / check out times to our site which triggers our company to know when to turn the homes with a cleaning service at check out. Our company can also arrange for a person to meet renters at check in with the keys and to show them around the home and provide any additional information. Extra add on services our company would provide include welcome baskets for guests.
